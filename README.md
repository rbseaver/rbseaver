# Rob Seaver, Developer Médiocre

OK, so I don't think I'm actually mediocre, but as a nod to my impostor syndrome, I couldn't bring myself to use "Developer Extraordinaire," even in a hyperbolic sense. And admit it, it made you look, right? Plus, I'm studying Cajun French right now, so it's practice!

## Who am I?

I'm a software engineer, husband, and father of one human and [two cats](./cats.md). I'm a bit of a goofball, and enjoy playing banjo, guitar, fiddle, with varying degress of competence. So, how about some factoids?

💻 I enjoy writing code (obviously)

🎶 Music sustains me. Here are a few bullets about my musical interests:

- 🎙️Old-time folk, blues, and country. Anything pre-1950 really gets my blood pumping.
- 🪗 Cajun music. This is a recent obsession. I love the accordion and the fiddle. I've also started learning Cajun French, which was unexpected. I was never a big fan of French in school, *mais, asteur moi j'aime apprendre le français Cadien!*
- 🪕 I play the banjo and guitar, and am teaching myself how to fiddle.

💑 I am married and have a son who just turned 18. We also have two cats, Peter and Gwen. Yes, they're named after the characters in Spider-Man. Peter is a big orange tabby, and Gwen is a petite tuxedo cat.

📺 The best TV show to ever air is Deadwood. I will fight you on this.

💤I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine. While it's helped me get better sleep, my wife is most excited by the fact that I no longer snore.

🚶I like taking 20 minute walks daily. It helps clear my head, get some fresh air, and get some exercise. I have actually lost weight, though it was not the primary goal.

🏫 I attended college for four years, then dropped out during my senior year. My major was Spanish, with a minor in anthropology. Regrets are ever-present, but I try to remind myself that I turned out fine, and have been successful in life in my career in spite of it.

🏠 I haved lived in Texas for the past twenty-five years, but I grew up in the Northeast &mdash; New Jersey, to be exact. When I first moved here, everyone was so friendly that I thought they were just trying to get something from me. After a few years, I learned how to be "Texas polite" and for the most part, consider myself a Texan now. Every once in a while a New Jersey-ism slips out, but it's rarer with each passing year.
